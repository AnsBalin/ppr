We review the derivation of a dynamic density functional theory (DDFT) including some aspects of hydrodynamic interactions and its application to the micro-rheology of suspensions. In particular we discuss the failure of Stokes' law in suspensions and non-equilibrium solvent structure mediated interactions. With regard to hydrodynamic chromatography we also discuss the stationary transport of particles in narrow channels, and the reasons for the failure of DDFT in this situation.},

abstract = {We consider the rotational motion of an elongated nanoscale object in a fluid under an external torque. The experimentally observed dynamics could be understood from analytical solutions of the Stokes equation, with explicit formulae derived for the dynamical states as a function of the object dimensions and the parameters defining the external torque. Under certain conditions, multiple analytical solutions to the Stokes equations exist, which have been investigated through numerical analysis of their stability against small perturbations and their sensitivity towards initial conditions. These experimental results and analytical formulae are general enough to be applicable to the rotational motion of any isolated elongated object at low Reynolds numbers, and could be useful in the design of non-spherical nanostructures for diverse applications pertaining to microfluidics and nanoscale propulsion technologies.},

@article{Janssen2009,
abstract = {We demonstrate that a rotating magnetic field can be used to apply a controlled torque on superparamagnetic beads which leads to a tunable bead rotation frequency in fluid. Smooth rotation is obtained for field rotation frequencies many orders of magnitude higher than the bead rotation frequency. A quantitative model is developed, based on results from a comprehensive set of experiments at different field strengths and frequencies. At low frequencies (<10Hz), rotation is due to a small permanent magnetic moment in the bead. At high frequencies (kHz-MHz), the torque results from a phase lag between the applied field and the induced magnetic moment, caused by the non-zero relaxation time of magnetic nanoparticles in the bead. The control of torque and rotation will enable novel functional assays in bead-based biosensors.},

abstract = {Microrobots have been proposed for future biomedical applications in which they are able to navigate in viscous fluidic environments. Nature has inspired numerous microrobotic locomotion designs, which are suitable for propulsion generation at low Reynolds numbers. This article reviews the various swimming methods with particular focus on helical propulsion inspired by E. coli bacteria. There are various magnetic actuation methods for biomimetic and non-biomimetic microrobots, such as rotating fields, oscillating fields, or field gradients. They can be categorized into force-driven or torque-driven actuation methods. Both approaches are reviewed and a previous publication has shown that torque-driven actuation scales better to the micro- and nano-scale than force-driven actuation. Finally, the implementation of swarm or multi-agent control is discussed. The use of multiple microrobots may be beneficial for in vivo as well as in vitro applications. Thus, the frequency-dependent behavior of helical microrobots is discussed and preliminary experimental results are presented showing the decoupling of an individual agent within a group of three microrobots.},

abstract = {Catalytic micropumps consisting of Ti/Cr/Pt microtubes with diameters of 5-10 $\mu$m and tunable lengths in the range of 20-1000 $\mu$m are reported. Micropumps were fabricated by rolling up metallic nanomembranes into microtubes with an inner platinum layer. When immersed into a solution of hydrogen peroxide, the micropumps are activated by the catalytic decomposition of peroxide into oxygen microbubbles and water. Fluid pumping is demonstrated by the movement of polystyrene particles with a diameter of 1 $\mu$m through the catalytic microtubes. Concentrations from 0.009 to 11\% H(2)O(2) were employed to study the catalytic generation of microbubbles in micropumps with different lengths. A minimum concentration of 0.06\% fuel was determined to be sufficient to actuate the micropumps. Such devices based on rolled-up nanomembranes hold great promise for the integration into Lab-on-a-chip systems for sensing, sorting of particles and drug delivery.},

abstract = {Self-folded magnetic microtools with sharp ends are directed at enabling drilling and related incision operations of tissues, ex vivo, in a fluid with a viscosity similar to that of blood. These microtools change their rotation from a horizontal to a vertical one when they are immersed into a rotational magnetic field. Novel self-assembly paradigms with magnetic materials can enable the creation of remotely controlled and mass-produced tools for potential applications in minimally invasive surgery.},
